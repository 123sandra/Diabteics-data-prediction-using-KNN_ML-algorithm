# Diabteics-data-prediction-using-KNN_ML-algorithm
Developed a model with Diabetics dataset to predict whether a person has Diabetics or not with the help of K-Nearest Neighbor. 
> First i have ckecked if there is any null values present and i also removed unwanted columns <br>
> Split the dataset into Features that is input and Target that is output using iloc() function. <br>
> Then i scaled the dataset using MinMaxClassifier from Scikit-learn library. <br>
> Split the dataset for training and testing using test_train_split. <br>
> Imported KNeighborClassifier for KNN prediction <br>
> Find the Accuracy using metrics and found the Confusion matrix <br>
> Inserted new values for prediction <br>
> Plotted Diabetes Outcome using Piechart<br>

# Conclusion
The model works with a 80% accuracy.
